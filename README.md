## The Teeth, the Philippines' Nirvana
As said on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth_(Filipino_band)), is a Filipino rock band formed in 1993.The band is currently composed of Glenn Jacinto on vocals, Jerome Velasco on guitars, Pedz Narvaja on bass, Mike Dizon on drums, and Dok Sergio on guitars (formerly on bass). Their music style is described as a mix of alternative rock and grunge, with some shoegaze influences evident in their third full-length album, **"I was a Teenage Tree"**

**My personal favorite from the Album**

The band came out on top in the 1990's alternative rock boom with their top song: "Laklak," serving as a an anthem for drinking around the Philippines.
Teeth was formed in September 1993 by Glenn Jacinto (vocals), Jerome Velasco (guitars), Dok Sergio (guitars, formerly bass), Peding Narvaja (bass), and Mike Dizon (drums). Narvaja, Velasco, and Dizon were originally in a group called Riftshifta, while Jacinto was in Loudhouse.

The group took a massive hiatus focusing on other musical projects.
Like [Nirvana,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)) after the band disbanded, the individual members created bands that would go on to be successful. Jerome Velasco, Teeth's guitarist with former-[Eraserheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserheads) frontman Ely Buendia formed The Mongols(Now [Pupil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil_(band)), and was joined by Teeth’s bassist (later second guitarist) Dok Sergio.
One more known example of these individual members seperating and creating another band is Mike Dizon co-founding Sandwich in 1998 with [Eraserheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserheads)’ drummer Raimund Marasigan; and later in 2005, [Pedicab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicab_(band))

On May 15, 2014, the band reunited after 10 years of hiatus. For the first time, the band brought back Pedz Narvaja as bassist while Dok Sergio switched to guitars, thus making a five-piece line up. They performed a reunion concert at Metro Tent in Pasig. They later went on to perform several reunion shows in 2015. As of 2016, the band continued their other ventures as Jacinto and Narvaja are currently based in the United States, while Sergio and Velasco performs with Pupil and Dizon still plays drums with Sandwich and Pedicab.)
Hopefully, as time passes by, we are blessed with another release from the band, as fans, old and young await for their return.
