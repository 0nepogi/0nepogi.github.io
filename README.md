# The Teeth, the Philippines' Nirvana
As said on [Wikipedia](9https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth_(Filipino_band)), is a Filipino rock band formed in 1993.[1] The band is currently composed of Glenn Jacinto on vocals, Jerome Velasco on guitars, Pedz Narvaja on bass, Mike Dizon on drums, and Dok Sergio on guitars (formerly on bass). Their music style is described as a mix of alternative rock and grunge, with some shoegaze influences evident in their third full-length album, **"I was a Teenage Tree"**

As you can see in the video, the Ragdoll is among the **largest breeds of cats**, along with the [Maine Coon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon), [Norwegian Forest Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Forest_cat), and the [Ragamuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragamuffin_cat)
When they are first born, they are a pure white color, with their color coming in 2 weeks after they are born.
Another fact about their fur is that the more darker colors in their coat appear on the colder parts of their body, like their feet and the end of their tails.
